  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>My name is Mark. I guess you can waste your time and read more below.</p>

  <p>Hello! I'm the only web developer who codes with one hand while juggling rubber chickens with the other.
    In my world, coffee is a programming language and my keyboard is the canvas. I started coding when I accidentally
    mistook HTML for a type of sandwich. Since then, I've been passionately creating websites that not only function
    superbly but also can tell a good joke.</p>

  <p>I'm a certified expert in CSS (Cats Supervising Software), fluent in Python (and by Python, I mean the actual
    snake,
    which makes typing really challenging). My design philosophy? If it doesn't make you chuckle, it's not on my screen.
    I've worked on numerous projects, from creating a social network for plants (they have a lot to say, apparently) to
    developing an app that translates baby talk into Shakespearean English.</p>

  <p>When I'm not busy being a semi-professional unicorn trainer or mastering the art of underwater yodeling, you'll
    find
    me in the wilderness, teaching squirrels about the importance of responsive design. My ultimate goal is to make the
    internet a place where fun and functionality coexist in quirky harmony. Remember, a day without laughter is a day
    wasted, and a website without humor is just... well, a bunch of code.</p>
